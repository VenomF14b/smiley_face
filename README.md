# smiley_face
The code uses the turtle module to create a graphical representation of a smiley face.
The turtle screen is set up with a white background.
A turtle named 'smiley' is created with a circular shape, yellow color, and a drawing speed of 2.
The draw_smiley function is defined to draw the components of the smiley face (face, eyes, and smile).
The smiley face is animated by calling draw_smiley, pausing for 1 second using time.sleep, and then clearing the drawing.
The animation is repeated twice.
The turtle graphics window closes when clicked.
The code is a simple example of using the Turtle graphics library to create basic drawings and animations. It introduces concepts like turtle movement, drawing shapes, and creating functions for reusable code. The resulting output is an animated smiley face on the turtle graphics window.
